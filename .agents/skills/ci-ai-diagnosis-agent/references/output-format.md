# Output Format Specification

The diagnosis JSON is the machine-readable source of truth. The Markdown
report is the human-readable projection. Both are emitted by the diagnosis
agent after the evidence + hypothesis phases complete.

## 2. Markdown Report Structure

The Markdown report MUST contain all 11 sections below in order. Section
numbering is part of the contract — downstream tools match on the headings.
If a section has no data, include the heading and add a placeholder.

### 2.1 诊断结论 (Direction + Root Cause Summary)

- Classification and confidence badge
- One-line failure direction (e.g., "Inference batch timed out — product bug")
- Root cause summary (2-3 sentences)

### 2.2 环境概要 (Environment Summary)

A 2-column table:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Runner | `linux-aarch64-a3-0` |
| Image | `cann:9.0.0-910b-ubuntu22.04-py3.12` |
| Config | `llama3_70B_single_node.yaml` |
| Hardware | `Ascend 910B` |
| vLLM version | `0.6.4` |
| vLLM-Ascend version | `0.5.0` |

Also include the diagnosis metadata (generated_at, step_name, log_file).

### 2.3 关键时间线 (Key Timeline)

A table with columns: time, component, event. Ordered chronologically.
Include multi-component offsets when available.

Example:

| 时间 | 组件 | 事件 |
|---|---|---|
| 12:00:01 | Coordinator | Starting pod |
| 12:00:10 | P Server | Registered RPC handler |
| 12:00:15 | D Worker | Started model loading |
| 12:00:45 | P Server | Request timeout |
| 12:00:46 | CI | EngineDeadError |

### 2.4 证据链 (Evidence Chain)

A table with columns: 来源 | 日志位置 | 日志内容 | 推导结论.

| 来源 | 日志位置 | 日志内容 | 推导结论 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main CI log | leader_logs.txt:3200 | `RPC call timed out after 30s` | D worker did not respond |
| Ascend worker logs | worker_rank3.log:1180 | `RuntimeError: connection closed by peer` | Rank-local failure happened before wrapper |
| K8s diagnostics | pods.json:1 | `phase=Running restartCount=0` | Pod-level failure is unlikely |

If a source was required but missing, add a row with `来源=missing` and
explain the diagnostic impact.

### 2.5 失败路径对比 (Success vs Failure Comparison)

A table comparing a successful baseline request path against the failure path.

| Checkpoint | 成功 Baseline | 失败 Request |
|---|---|---|
| Request received | 12:00:01 | 12:01:30 |
| Prefill started | 12:00:02 | 12:01:31 |
| Prefill completed | 12:00:05 | — 无 — |
| First token sent | 12:00:06 | — 无 — |

The `— 无 —` marker explicitly shows where the failure diverged.

### 2.6 故障链路总览 (Failure Chain Overview)

A Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` showing the full causal chain:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Coordinator
    participant P as P Server
    participant D as D Worker

    Client->>Coordinator: /v1/chat/completions
    Coordinator->>P: schedule request
    P->>D: RPC generate(prefill)
    Note over D: prefill queue backlog (max_num_batched_tokens=256)
    D-->>P: RPC timeout after 30s
    P-->>Coordinator: EngineDeadError
    Coordinator-->>Client: 500 Internal Server Error
```

### 2.7 根因分析 (Root Cause Analysis)

A 2-3 sentence layered analysis covering:

- **表象 (Appearance)**: What CI shows
- **直接原因 (Direct Cause)**: The immediate trigger
- **加剧因素 (Aggravating Factor)**: What made it worse
- **诱因 (Trigger)**: The code/config change that introduced the failure

Presented as a table:

| 层级 | 根因 |
|---|---|
| 表象 | EngineDeadError at CI summary |
| 直接原因 | RPC call to D worker timed out after 30s |
| 加剧因素 | max_num_batched_tokens=256 causes prefill queue bloat |
| 诱因 | Commit aba1234 increased model params without adjusting batch config |

### 2.8 排除项 (Excluded Items)

A bulleted list of things the agent explicitly considered and ruled out:

- Coordinator scheduling issue — log shows `schedule succeeded` at line 2800
- Image pull failure — pods were Running
- K8s resource shortage — all pods had sufficient resources
- Network partition — RPC registration succeeded

Also list cross-source exclusions. Example: K8s summary shows pods were
Running with `restartCount=0`, so do not classify the failure as
CrashLoopBackOff even if the main log later shows HTTP 500.

### 2.9 下一步行动 (Next Actions)

A table with priority, direction, action, and confidence:

| Priority | Direction | Action | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Short-term | Increase max_num_batched_tokens | high |
| P1 | Mid-term | Add RPC timeout metrics | medium |
| P2 | Long-term | Add dynamic batch sizing | low |

### 2.10 修复建议 (Fix Recommendations)

Three subsections:

#### 修复建议

**短期（运维）** — What an on-call engineer can do today:
1. Restart the failed job
2. Increase `max_num_batched_tokens` in config.yaml

**中期（配置）** — Config changes:
1. Set `VLLM_ENGINE_READY_TIMEOUT_S=3600`
2. Reduce concurrent request count

**长期（代码/架构）** — Code/architecture changes:
1. Add dynamic batch sizing
2. Implement RPC timeout retry with backoff

### 2.11 关键日志检索命令 (Retrieval Commands)

Bash commands to re-derive the findings from the log:

```bash
# Find RPC timeout events
grep -n "timed out" /tmp/leader_logs.txt

# Find EngineDeadError context
grep -B 20 "EngineDeadError" /tmp/leader_logs.txt | head -40

# Check batch config settings
grep -n "max_num_batched_tokens\|max_num_seqs" /tmp/leader_logs.txt
```

## 3. Evidence Bundle Format (Pre-LLM)

When `ci_diagnosis_agent.py` runs in **evidence bundle mode** (no LLM),
it outputs a JSON bundle with this structure:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "type": "evidence_bundle",
  "generated_at": "ISO-8601",
  "step_name": "tests",
  "log_file": "/path/to/log",
  "index": { /* output of build_index() */ },
  "git_context": { /* git branch, commit, changed_files */ },
  "evidence": [
    {
      "request": {"tool": "get_first_exception_context"},
      "payload": { /* tool output */ }
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_evidence": 5,
    "has_traceback": true,
    "has_failed_tests": true,
    "has_artifacts": false
  }
}
```

This bundle is consumed by the LLM agent (when invoked via the skill) to
avoid re-reading the raw log file.

## 4. Rendering Rules

1. Every claim in `root_cause` and `evidence` must reference a `{file, line}` pair.
2. Every wrapper error must be traced upstream (or explained why it cannot be).
3. Every hypothesis in `candidate_routes` must have at least one `supporting_evidence` entry.
4. Every diagnosis must list `evidence_sources[]`, even when only the main CI log was available.
5. Missing required sources must be listed in `missing_sources[]` with impact.
6. Unresolved source conflicts must be listed in `source_conflicts[]`.
7. `classification` must be exactly one of the allowed values.
8. `confidence` must be exactly `high`, `medium`, or `low`.
9. If requirements cannot be met, set `needs_human_review = true`.
10. Markdown sections with no data must still include the heading with a placeholder.
